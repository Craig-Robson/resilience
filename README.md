### What is this repository for? ###

This python module allows for the analysis of networks through a number of perturbation methods. The module utilises the python based NetworkX library and associated classes for the handling and analysis of the networks. This module is also directly compatible to the Newcastle University develoepd nx_pgnet module, which optimises a postgreSQL/postGIS database set up for the manipulation and storage of networks as stand alone systems as well as dependent and interdependent systems.
